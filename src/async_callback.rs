/// available within the created future is **meaningless** and has a NOOP waker; we are only using
/// `async` as a stable way to express what would be better expressed as a simple coroutine.
///
/// It is possible to integrate proper async APIs with `piccolo`, and to even have a method to
/// "wake" Lua coroutines with a *real* [`std::task::Waker`], but simply calling an external async
/// function from the created future here is *not* the way to do it. It will not do what you want,
/// and probably will result in panics.
///
/// The provided `create` function is given two parameters: a [`Locals`] object to stash values
/// that will be owned by the future, and an [`AsyncSequence`] object which the future shuld use to
/// control the `Sequence` from the inside. The callback is called immediately and is not required
/// to be `'static`, it exists only to construct the controlling future.
///
/// The provided `create` function should only stash local variables and move the `AsyncSequence`
/// object into the returned future, nothing more. The `AsyncSequence` handle is `'static` for
/// simplicity, but it should not be moved out of the returned future or have methods called on it
/// outside of the returned future, this will result in panics!
///
/// The returned future can capture `'static` variables from the outer scope as well as stashed
/// local variables, but it *cannot* capture anything branded with a `'gc` lifetime, as this will
/// result in compiler errors. There is no way in today's Rust for futures created from `async`
/// blocks to implement the `Collect` trait, so we must accept futures that do *not* implement
/// `Collect` and *can't* hold `'gc` branded values. This is the reason why we provide a `Locals`:
/// to instead allow the future to hold onto these GC values indirectly.
///
/// # Panics
///
/// All Rust yields (`.await`) within the returned future must occur from calling an async method
/// on the `AsyncSequence` handle. If some other future is `.await`ed, this will cause the outer
/// `Sequence` poll methods to panic.
///
/// Methods on `AsyncSequence` must *only* be called from the returned future. Calling methods on
/// `AsyncSequence` directly from the provided create function or from storing the `AsyncSequence`
/// somewhere else will result in a panic.
